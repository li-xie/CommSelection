Simulating simple H-M community selection, selecting top 2, fixed total Newborn biomass.
* In Heritability/ , heritability of community function and determinants are calculated from C549 of the simulation.
* With Heritability/NoSpike/DeterminantDist.m , fp(0) and phiM(0) of all Newborns are normalized to compare to the normal distribution.
