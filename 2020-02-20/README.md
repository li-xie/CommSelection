# Simulate community selection on HM communities:
Most results in this folder are not used because Spearman correlation coefficient might not be the best metric for heritability. 44-46 are no spiking control.
- Spike with specified numbers of H and M clones.
- Switch among selecting spiking strategy with highest heritability, lowest heritability or randomly.
- Calculate heritability with Spearman correlation after removing outliners.
- Communities reproduce through pipetting.
- 4 phenotypes of M and 2 phenotypes of H can be modified by mutations.
