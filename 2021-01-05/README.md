# Simulate community selection on HM communities:
- Spike with specified numbers of H and M clones.
- Calculate heritability with slope from least square linear regression of parent-offspring community function after removing outliners.
- Check heritability when selection stalls. 
- Switch to a spiking strategy with highest heritability.
- Communities reproduce through pipetting.
- 4 phenotypes of M and 2 phenotypes of H can be modified by mutations.
