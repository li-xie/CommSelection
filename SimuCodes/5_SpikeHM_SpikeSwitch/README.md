Simulate community selection on HM communities:
..* Spike with specified numbers of H and M clones.
..* Switch among selecting spiking strategy with highest heritability, lowest heritability or randomly.
..* Calculate heritability with Spearman correlation after removing outliners.
..* Communities reproduce through pipetting.
..* 4 phenotypes of M and 2 phenotypes of H can be modified by mutations.
